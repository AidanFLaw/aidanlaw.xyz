## Professional Journey

### From Intern to Technology Director
My technology career began as an IT intern at [Food Warming Equipment](https://fwe.com) during high school, where I learned the fundamentals of enterprise IT support and manufacturing systems. This hands-on experience at every level—from help desk support to infrastructure architecture—gives me unique insight into the practical challenges organizations face.

### Healthcare IT Focus
Transitioning into healthcare IT, I discovered my passion for solving the complex intersection of technology, compliance, and patient care. Managing IT operations for a large surgical practice has taught me that healthcare technology must be both cutting-edge and utterly reliable.

### Entrepreneurial Experience
As co-owner of [Kayaking St. Augustine](https://kayakingstaugustine.com), I understand the business side of operations—managing costs, optimizing efficiency, and delivering exceptional customer experiences. This entrepreneurial perspective informs my approach to healthcare IT consulting.

## Why I Focus on Healthcare IT

Healthcare practices face unique challenges that generic IT consultants often don't understand:
- Patient care can't be interrupted for system maintenance
- Compliance requirements are complex and constantly evolving
- Legacy systems often contain years of critical patient data
- Staff training time is limited and valuable

Having managed these challenges daily in a large surgical practice, I bring real-world experience and practical solutions to every engagement.

## Personal Interests

When not solving healthcare IT challenges, I enjoy working on my homelab infrastructure, staying current with emerging technologies, and exploring the intersection of technology and business operations. I'm also learning Polish ("Mówię trochę po polsku") and enjoy the mental challenge of language acquisition.
