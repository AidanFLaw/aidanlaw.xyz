## Professional Summary

I solve the tech problems that keep practice managers awake at night. After 10+ years across healthcare, manufacturing, and defense contracting, I've learned that the best solutions come from understanding both the technical complexities and the daily realities of running a medical practice.

**Currently:** Managing all technology operations for a 300+ employee surgical practice across multiple locations. Think less "IT guy" and more "the person who makes sure your systems actually work when you need them."

## Professional Journey

### From Intern to Technology Director
My technology career began as an IT intern at [Food Warming Equipment](https://fwe.com) during high school, where I learned the fundamentals of enterprise IT support and manufacturing systems. This hands-on experience at every level—from help desk support to infrastructure architecture—gives me unique insight into the practical challenges organizations face.

### Finding My Niche in Healthcare
Transitioning into healthcare tech, I discovered my passion for solving problems at the intersection of technology, compliance, and patient care. Managing operations for a large surgical practice has taught me that medical technology must be both cutting-edge and utterly reliable—no pressure, right?

### Entrepreneurial Experience
As co-owner of [Kayaking St. Augustine](https://kayakingstaugustine.com), I understand the business side of operations—managing costs, optimizing efficiency, and delivering exceptional customer experiences. This entrepreneurial perspective informs my approach to technology consulting (and keeps me grounded in real-world budget constraints).

## Why Healthcare Tech is Different

Medical practices face challenges that generic tech consultants often don't grasp:
- Patient care can't stop for system maintenance
- Compliance requirements are complex and constantly changing
- Legacy systems contain years of irreplaceable patient data
- Staff training time is limited and precious

Having wrestled with these challenges daily in a large surgical practice, I bring battle-tested experience and practical solutions to every project.

## Personal Interests

When not solving tech challenges, I enjoy tinkering with my homelab infrastructure, staying current with emerging technologies, and exploring how tech and business operations intersect. I'm also learning Polish ("Mówię trochę po polsku") and enjoying the mental gymnastics of language acquisition.

Outside of technology, I love cooking (especially experimenting with new techniques and cuisines) and rock climbing, which has taught me a lot about problem-solving under pressure and the importance of having solid backup systems.
