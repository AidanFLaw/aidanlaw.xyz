# Multi-Location Surgical Practice Infrastructure
**Healthcare IT Infrastructure Modernization**

---

## Executive Summary

A growing surgical practice with 300+ employees across multiple locations needed to modernize their IT infrastructure while maintaining continuous patient care operations. The project required HIPAA-compliant architecture, zero-downtime implementation, and seamless integration across all practice locations.

**Timeline:** 6 months | **Budget:** Delivered 15% under budget | **Downtime:** Zero unplanned outages
