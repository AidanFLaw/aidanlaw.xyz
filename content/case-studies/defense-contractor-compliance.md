# Defense Contractor DFARS Compliance
**DFARS & NIST 800-171 Compliance Implementation**

---

## Executive Summary

A growing defense contractor needed to achieve DFARS (Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement) and NIST 800-171 compliance to maintain and expand their government contracting capabilities. The project required comprehensive security architecture design, access control implementation, and audit preparation within a tight timeline.

**Timeline:** 4 months | **Compliance Status:** Achieved | **Audit Result:** Zero findings
