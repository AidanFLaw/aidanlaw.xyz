## <i class="fa-solid fa-question-circle"></i> Frequently Asked Questions

### What makes your approach different from other tech consultants?
I focus exclusively on medical practices with real-world experience managing technology for a 300+ employee surgical practice. This gives me practical insight into the daily challenges you face—from compliance nightmares to workflow optimization.

### Do you work with practices of all sizes?
Yes, though my expertise is particularly valuable for practices with 25+ employees who need professional-grade infrastructure, compliance management, and custom solutions. Smaller practices benefit from strategic planning and security implementations.

### What's your typical project timeline?
- **Assessments:** 1-2 weeks
- **Infrastructure Projects:** 2-6 months depending on scope
- **Compliance Implementations:** 3-4 months
- **Custom Development:** 1-3 months depending on complexity

### How do you ensure minimal disruption to patient care?
Every implementation is designed with healthcare operations in mind. I use phased approaches, parallel system operation during transitions, and off-hours scheduling for critical changes. Zero-downtime migrations are standard for all infrastructure projects.

### What ongoing support do you provide?
Support structures are customized based on your needs—from one-time project delivery to ongoing managed services. Many clients benefit from quarterly reviews and proactive monitoring to maintain optimal performance and compliance.

**"We had a mixture of legacy servers, with security problems and reliability issues. The infrastructure transformation exceeded our expectations. We went from constant technology headaches to having complete confidence in our systems. Now data is no longer being lost and we were able to utilize the latest features of our clinical machines such as DICOM and AI integration."**
